##### In Lab 1, the pre-processing of ChEMBL database for molecules, where we refine and filter the database for SARS coronavirus 3C-like proteinase, we get to know the different drugs that inhibit the sars coronavirus 3C-like proteinase and make a database out of it

##### In Lab 2, we did exploratory data analysis and converted the data on the basis of the Lipinski's rule, which tells the druglikeness of a compound, we then plotted several plots comparing the active and inactive compounds to all the 4 Lipinski descriptors, and proved statistically using mann-whitney test that the inactive and active types are significantly different.
